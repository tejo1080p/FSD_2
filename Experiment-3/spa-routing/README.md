# Experiment 3: Implement Routing in SPA

## Aim
To implement client-side routing in a Single Page Application using React Router.

## Software Required
- Node.js
- npm
- React
- react-router-dom

## Theory
A Single Page Application (SPA) loads only one HTML file. Navigation between pages is handled using JavaScript without reloading the page. React Router enables client-side routing in React applications.

## Procedure
1. Create a React application.
2. Install react-router-dom.
3. Create components for different pages.
4. Configure routes using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.
5. Use Link component for navigation.

## Output
Navigation between pages without page reload.

## Result
Client-side routing was successfully implemented in a Single Page Application using React Router.
